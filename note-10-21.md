## syntactic sugar
- when you have a programming language with a simple syntax, but we need some conveniences sometimes
- not necessary to the language, but makes your life a lot nicer.
- i.e. in Lisp, like '() instead of (QUOTE ()) 

## levels of analysis
- prosody, tune of the language
- phonology, sound of the language
- morphology, parts of the word and how they fit together
- syntax/grammar, how meaningful strings of languages are constructed
- sematics: the meaning of each valid string
- pragmatics: meaning in conversational context
- dialogue: understanding an entire exchange.

greater focus on syntax of semantics.
- how do we get from a piece of written text --> a meaning.

## stages of analysis
- speech analysis --> text, annotated text
- syntactic analysis --> parse tree
- semantic analysis --> predicate logic (prolog), semantic network
- pragmatic/dialogue analysis --> database query language (like sql), specialized translation representation

## ambiguity
- when two or more interpretations are produced at some stage of processing
- syntactic ambiguitiy: i watched mary with a telescope
- pragmatic ambiguity: do you have time?
- phonological ambiguity: bear/bare.
- goal of NLP is to get rid of this ambiguity. need to know what they want.
- when you get into humor, ambiguity should instead be kept in.

## parsing
- process of figuring out the syntactic sugar of a piece of text.

## what is formal grammar
- a finite set of terminal symbols (words)
    - Kim, Likes, A, Do~g
- finite set of non-terminal symbols (phrase structure labels)
    - PN, N, C, Det, VP, NP, PP
        - Proper Noun (PN)
        - Noun (N)
        - Complementizer (C)
        - Determiner (Det)
        - Verb Phrase (VP)
        - Noun Phrase (NP)
        - Prepositional Phrase (PP)


- set of production rules with left/right hand side consistent of a string of these symbols
    - S â†’ NP VP. This rule states that a sentence (S) consists of a noun phrase (NP) followed by a verb phrase (VP).
- a start symbol
    - S

## chomsky hierarchy of formal grammars
- A, B non-terminals
- a,g,b strings consistening of terminals and non-terminals
- t terminal 
- higher = more expressive, lower = more efficient the parsing algorithms

- terminals are words
- everything else is non-terminal

## exercise
- make a grammar that gives both parse trees for "jill watched mike with a telescope"
    - PP "with the telescope"
    - NP "mike with the telescope"
    - V "jill watched mike with the telescope"

V --> NP + PP 

 PN     VP    PN  PREP DET N
jill watched mike with the telescope

S --> NP + VP

NP --> PN
NP --> DET N
Mike with the telescope >
NP --> NP PP
-----------
PP --> Prep NP

VP --> V NP
VP --> V NP PP

```
     S (start)
    / \
  PN   VP        
  /    / \
jill  V   PN
     /     \        
  watched   mike     Prep 
                      / 
                    with  
                          /   
\
                        the telescope
```
Take #2
```
S
|--- PN
|    |---jill
|
|--- VP
|    |---
|

```
